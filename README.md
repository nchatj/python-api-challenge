Observable Trends:
1. Lower latitude areas have higher temperatures. This makes sense as lower latitudes is closer to the equator.
2. There are higher numbers of high humidity areas than there are low humidity areas. They both do not seem to show a relationship with latitude.
3. Wind speed did not show a relationship with latitude in both northern and southern hemispheres.
